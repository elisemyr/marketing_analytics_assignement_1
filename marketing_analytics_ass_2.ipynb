    "### Product 1\n",
    "- **Observed Change:** The ratio of new to old quantity for Product 1 is approximately 0.8564, which is less than 1. This indicates a decrease in demand for Product 1.\n",
    "- **Reason:** The demand for Product 1 decreases primarily because of the 5% price increase. According to the own-price elasticity of -2.5, Product 1 is highly price-sensitive, meaning even a small increase in price leads to a significant reduction in quantity demanded. As calculated, this increase in price outweighs any potential gains from the cross-price elasticities with Products 2 and 3, resulting in an overall drop in demand for Product 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Product 2\n",
    "- **Observed Change:** The ratio of new to old quantity for Product 2 is approximately 0.9659, which is slightly less than 1. This indicates a minor decrease in demand for Product 2.\n",
    "- **Reason:** Despite no change in its own price, Product 2 experiences a small decrease in demand. This change is due to the indirect effects of the price changes for Products 1 and 3. Product 2’s cross-price elasticity with Product 1 (0.6) and Product 3 (0.4) slightly impact its demand, as the 5% increase in Product 1’s price does not fully counteract the 15% decrease in Product 3’s price. This suggests that, while the products are somewhat substitutable, the changes in other products’ prices only minimally impact the demand for Product 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Product 3\n",
    "- **Observed Change:** The ratio of new to old quantity for Product 3 is approximately 1.2067, which is greater than 1. This indicates an increase in demand for Product 3.\n",
    "- **Reason:** The 15% price reduction for Product 3 drives this increase in demand. With an own-price elasticity of -1.25, Product 3 is moderately price-sensitive, so the price cut leads to a noticeable boost in its quantity demanded. Additionally, although Products 1 and 2 have minor cross-price effects on Product 3, these are not strong enough to offset the positive demand effect of the price reduction. As a result, the demand for Product 3 rises due to the increased affordability from its lower price.\n"

    "### Product 1\n",
    "- **Observed Change:** The profit for Product 1 decreased by approximately 14.34%.\n",
    "- **Reason for Change:** The decrease in profit for Product 1 is primarily due to its price increase. With an own-price elasticity of -2.5, Product 1 is highly sensitive to changes in its own price. The 5% price increase led to a significant reduction in demand, which in turn decreased the total profit. Although the profit margin per unit increased, the reduction in quantity sold outweighed this gain, resulting in an overall decrease in profit.\n",
    "- **Benefit or Loss:** Product 1 did not benefit from the price increase because the demand drop was too steep due to high price sensitivity. This indicates that, for highly elastic products, even moderate price increases can negatively impact profits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Product 2\n",
    "- **Observed Change:** The profit for Product 2 decreased by approximately 3.51%.\n",
    "- **Reason for Change:** The profit decrease for Product 2 is relatively minor, as its price remained constant. However, it experienced a small drop in demand due to the cross-price effects from Products 1 and 3. Specifically, the price increase for Product 1 and the price decrease for Product 3 impacted Product 2 slightly, as there are some substitutive relationships between these products.\n",
    "- **Benefit or Loss:** Product 2 did not benefit from the price changes, but the impact was minimal. The small decrease in profit shows that Product 2 is relatively stable in terms of profit, as it was less affected by the changes in prices of other products.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Product 3\n",
    "- **Observed Change:** The profit for Product 3 decreased by approximately 22.29%.\n",
    "- **Reason for Change:** Although the 15% price cut led to an increase in demand, the reduction in profit margin per unit was substantial. With a moderate own-price elasticity of -1.25, the demand increase was not enough to fully offset the loss in profit per unit. The result is a considerable decrease in profit.\n",
    "- **Benefit or Loss:** Product 3 did not benefit from the price cut, as the loss in per-unit profit outweighed the gain from increased demand.\n",
    "- **Is the Price Cut Justified?:** The price cut for Product 3 does not appear justified. While the intention of reducing the price was likely to boost sales volume, the product's elasticity was not high enough to make up for the reduced profit margin. As a result, the overall profit decreased. In this case, the price cut led to a significant loss in profitability, indicating that a less aggressive price reduction or no price change might have been a better strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "- **Product 1:** Experienced a profit decrease due to its high price sensitivity. The price increase was not beneficial for profitability.\n",
    "- **Product 2:** Saw a small decrease in profit, affected slightly by cross-price elasticities. Its stable profit indicates minimal impact from other products’ price changes.\n",
    "- **Product 3:** Faced a large profit decrease due to the price cut, as the demand increase was insufficient to counter the margin loss. The price cut was not justified based on the observed impact on profitability.\n"
